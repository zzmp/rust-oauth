rust-oauth
==========

Basic oAuth in RUST

*This project is part of a [Hack Reactor](http://hackreactor.com/) hackathon.*

### Roadmap - intentionally left vague

* *Every iterative advance should be followed by a generalization to crates, so that code remains consumable.*

- [X] Wrap request handler (proto-middleware style)

 - Hello, world!

- [X] Create a redirecting server

- [ ] Integrate [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-postgres)

 - Begin by storing basic information on server use and/or client origin

- [ ] Point redirection to oAuth and store tokens

- [ ] Authorize tokens server-to-server

- [ ] Store authorized tokens

- [ ] Log requests/responses

 - Possible side-project: Kenny (Loggins)?

- [ ] Implement persistent sessions

- [ ] Redirect to login unless sessioned (gated server)

- [ ] Serve static files
